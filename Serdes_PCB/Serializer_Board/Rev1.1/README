# REV1.1

# NOTES:
- Removed a ton of LDO regulators and keeping 4 total regulators 3.3V, 1.8V corresponding to core circuitry powering and USB powering
- Any unnecessary connectors removed
- SSC crystal removed as component is not needed
- Deleted the D33_POWER_SCHEMATIC.SchDoc 
- No errors or Warnings after ERC checks

# 2/1/26 updates:
- Removed a zero ohm resistor next to VDD3P3 on BuckRegulatorOnSer schematic 
- Replaced a 53k and 5.69k ohm resistors and found equivalent on Manufacturer part serach
- Completed layout of buck converter (but it looks horrible)

# 2/7/26 updates:
- Restarted layout and instead of putting every component on the top side of the board, some of the components were put on the bottom side
- Finished Buck and two LDOs from the buck

//To-DO: 
- Continue routing the power of other LDO from the USB
- Still have to adjust design rules so theres no DRC errors
