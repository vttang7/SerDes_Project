-Uploaded D14 buck converter and it's circuitry schematic
-Uploaded D34 buck converters to power the deserializer itself and POC feed via buck converters
//NOTE: For D14 deserialzer, we can duplicate the power slides from the Serializer

//TO-DO: Still need the D34 serializer schematic circuitry done, coax schematic for initial design purposes. Schematic analysis to simplify design
