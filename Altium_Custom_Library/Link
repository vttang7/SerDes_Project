This is my custom library schematic and footprints. I think everyone should download this to view the symbols and footprint in the schematic for future reference.

Also, sorry it's a Google Drive link because the footprint library was too big to upload, and I can't even upload the zip file onto GitHub.

If there are permission issues, let me know.
